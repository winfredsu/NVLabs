			<p>Before we dive into nonvolatile processors in detail, let's start with a question on IoT processors: <strong>what is the desired features of processors in IoT edge devices?</strong> This question is quite important because the processors acts as the "brain" of IoT devices and handles most of the computation and control tasks. As shown in Figure 1, we identify four features that an IoT processor should have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ultra-low power:</strong> </li>
				<li><strong>High efficiency:</strong> </li> 

			</ul>

			<p>Conventional processors can hardly meet all those requirements for several reasons:</p>
